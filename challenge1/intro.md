We are going to make a classifier. We want be able to predict Building Type (the *Bldg Type* column) from the other columns in the dataset.

To complete this challenge you will need to create a pipeline for a machine learning classifier.

By the end of this challenge, you will use pandas to prepare data so they can
put it into a machine learning model. This includes - taking a raw data file and
removing or calculating missing values. Then you will create a pipeline to
standardize the numeric values and create dummy columns. Finally, you will add a classifier.

Good luck!
