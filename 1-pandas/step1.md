# Install Libraries

We are going to use ``virtualenv`` and ``pip`` to install our libraries.

First we need to install virtualenv. Run the following:

`apt install python3.8-venv`{{execute}}

Create and activate the virtual environment:

`python3 -m venv env`{{execute}}

`source env/bin/activate`{{execute}}

Finally install the libraries:

`pip install pandas scikit-learn pytest`{{execute}}

Make sure you scroll down in the Terminal to ensure that the commands were successful.

When you have run all the commands click the *Continue* button.
